# Agile Project Management

Agile methodology was used for project management, with a focus on iterative development and reassessment. The project was divided into sprints, each lasting two weeks, allowing for regular reflection and adjustments based on scope and feedback.

### User Personas
Personas were created to represent the target users of the application, helping to guide design and development decisions.


## Themes, Epics, and User Stories
