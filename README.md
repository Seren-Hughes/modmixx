## Purpose and Objectives

The music industry is undergoing significant changes, with independent artists facing challenges such as declining revenue from streaming platforms and the increasing use of AI-generated content by major record labels. These trends risk devaluing original, human-made music. However, the intrinsic value of music as a medium for creativity, connection, and community remains undiminished.

Music production offers benefits beyond financial gain, fostering personal growth, creative expression, and cognitive development. Skills such as synthesis, audio design, and instrument mastery (e.g., MIDI controllers or drum machines) have been shown to enhance brain health and support lifelong learning.

This project, **modmixx**, addresses the need for an inclusive, low-pressure environment where music creators‚Äîparticularly beginners, hobbyists, and underrepresented voices‚Äîcan share, experiment, and learn. Unlike existing platforms that prioritize polished content and algorithmic visibility, modmixx emphasizes sincerity, experimentation, and collaboration.

Developed as part of a full-stack web development diploma assessment, this platform is designed to demonstrate technical proficiency while addressing a real-world problem. The project is intended for long-term development, with the potential to evolve into a fully realized community-driven platform.
