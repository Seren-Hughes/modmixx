# Agile Project Management

Agile methodology was used for project management, with a focus on iterative development and reassessment. The project was divided into sprints, each lasting two weeks, allowing for regular reflection and adjustments based on scope and feedback.

### User Personas

## Themes, Epics, and User Stories
